Telegram Bot to compare prices

In Argentina with the high inflation rate that makes you feel that you have less and less money every month
makes one look for the best prices in every place.  Walk or pick the car drive some distance to get a better
price.

This bot purpose is to be an assistant to help with this task.

I started this project like 8 years ago, it was made in Perl at that time, and it helped to also keep notes
and statistics of all kind of things.  Now, being #opentowork i have some time and need to put my thoughts
some where, until i find my next job i started again but now in Python.
